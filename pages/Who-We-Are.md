The purpose of the organization is to promote and preserve the language and the broad-minded, humanity culture of the Vietnamese people. In August 2005, the Center changed its name to the current Au Co Vietnamese Cultural Center . The change is a necessity to be compatible with its services and to avoid being misunderstood as a private school by local communities, public agencies, organizations, and corporations. 

All programs of the Center are governed by the mission of the Center mentioned in its bylaw. In general, Au Co Center is a non-profit public interest organization with members who voluntarily participate and follow the purpose and principle of the organization. As established by the bylaw, the Center is supervised by a Board of Directors who are elected by members for a term of 2 year, and each year, half of the Directors are elected. The Executive Committee is responsible for the daily operation of the Center. The Executive Director (Chief of Executive Committee) is elected by members with a term of 2 years, cannot be re-elected for more than 2 consecutive terms, except as permitted by the Bylaw. The Executive Director has full power to select members of the Executive Committee.
